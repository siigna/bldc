# app_pas host tests

Host tests for the pedal decoder in `applications/app_pas.c`.

The real `app_pas.c` is compiled against the stub headers in this directory, so
the tests exercise the shipping decoder rather than a copy of it. Pad levels and
the virtual timer are driven from the test, which makes pedal timing
deterministic and allows uptime to be fast-forwarded.

The stubs cover only what `app_pas.c` calls: `ch.h`, `hal.h`, `hw.h`,
`mc_interface.h`, `timeout.h`, `commands.h`, `terminal.h` and an empty
`stm32f4xx_conf.h`. `datatypes.h` and `app.h` are the real headers, so
`pas_config` cannot drift from the firmware.

`hw.h` selects the board configuration from `-D` flags, so the pin and torque
sensor combinations can each be built:

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| (none) | dedicated pedal sensor pins, no torque sensor |
| `TEST_NO_PAS_PINS` | hardware with no pedal sensor pins at all |
| `TEST_PAS_PINS_SHARED` | pins shared with the COMM UART |
| `TEST_TORQUE_SENSOR` | hardware with a torque sensor |
